## My Role

Developed an inertial based navigation system which consumes angles ,positions and velocities of missile during its flight and produces expected angles, positions and velocities. These expected values help missile navigate to the exact target location. 
Their are corrective measures added at every stage to land at desired location.
Working for this project help me honed my programming skills and lateral thinking capability.
