## My Role

Started off by working on Metadata repository team for platform later moved into Adapter team. Got various opportunities to excel across the teams.
Below are few notable projects 
<br/>
 <b> ETL & Predictive Analytics </b>: Designed and developed a framework that can extract data from various cloud sources. The data is then cleaned/transformed and loaded into warehouse(MySQL) <br/>
 <b> Three-Way Merge </b>: Designed and developed a custom version control algorithm which is used to manage changes in a model on two independent builds and merge them eventually. 99% of the data merges without human intervention. <br/> 
 <b> Data mapper </b>: Developed an automated system to map different source entity attributes to generate data manipulative SQL blobs. This is used to design scalable warehouse and reduce the ETL development time
