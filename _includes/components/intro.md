I'm a graduate student majoring in Computer Science at Arizona State University, specializing in Machine Learning domain.
I'm a very curious person and learning new things has always been my passion. I enjoy learning and imparting the learnt theory to machines. I'm currently developing a novel architecture for machines to answer series of interconnected questions in a conversation using Bi-Directional Attention flow and LSTM (Encoder-Decoder) networks.
I have two years of work experience in Numerify (Business analytics) as a Software Engineer
